Our company spun out of the UC Berkeley AI Research Lab and develops artificial intelligence to support care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and other cognitive impairments. Alzheimer’s disease is the single most expensive disease in the US, costing an estimated $600b per year in direct and indirect costs. It affects 1 in 3 people over 85 and 1 in 9 people over 65. Our first product is focused on reducing the frequency and impact of falls, the leading cause of hospitalization for those living with dementia. We have peer-reviewed results showing up to 80% fewer falls with an average of 40% fewer falls and 80% fewer ER visits from falls. We've raised capital from top VC firms, including Founders Fund, Eclipse, Foundation Capital, and Data Collective, and the largest providers in the space are actively using, expanding, and evangelizing the service. We have also been awarded grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, given the national importance of the issue – as the population continues to age, the global costs of Alzheimer’s and dementia are expected to double over the next 10 years.
